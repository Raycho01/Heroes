# Heroes
Spring Boot Application

This is one of the last projects in SoftUni Java Web. The css and html files were provided by them as well as the idea of the whole project. I wrote the api and reconfigured the html files using Thymeleaf. You can log in as a user and have the options to create/delete/see your heroes. The hardest part was not to write the code but to adjust everything.
