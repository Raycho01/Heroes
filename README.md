# Heroes
Spring Boot Application

This is one of the projects in the last module of SoftUni Java Web path. The css and html files were provided by them as well as the idea of the whole project. I designed the API and reconfigured the html files using Thymeleaf. You can log in as a user and have the options to create/delete/see your heroes.
